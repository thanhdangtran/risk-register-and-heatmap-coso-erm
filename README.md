📘 Neo Finance – Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework
Risk Register • Risk Heatmap • KRI Dashboard • COSO ERM 2017
📌 Overview

This repository contains a complete Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) package built for a digital retail lending bank named Neo Finance.
The framework follows COSO ERM 2017 and includes risk identification, scoring, governance, KRI monitoring, heatmap visualization, and reporting cadence.

This project is part of my professional Risk Management portfolio, demonstrating practical ERM implementation for banking/fintech environments.

🧩 Contents Included
1. Risk Register (Excel)

Located in: Neo_Finance_Risk_Register.xlsx

Includes:

18 key risks across Credit, Fraud, Operational, Technology, Compliance, Liquidity, Model, Data Privacy, and Strategic/External.

Inherent & Residual scoring (Likelihood × Impact).

Control effectiveness evaluation.

Risk rating (RAG colors).

Risk owners & review frequency.

KRI linkage + appetite alignment.

2. Risk Heatmap (PPT)

Located in: Neo_Finance_Risk_Management.pptx

Includes:

Residual risk heatmap (5×5 matrix).

Top risks summary & prioritization.

COSO ERM mapping (Governance, Strategy, Performance, Review, Reporting).

KRI dashboard with thresholds & trend indicators.

Monthly/Quarterly monitoring cadence.

60–90 day action plan for risk reduction.

Summary of risk appetite & limit structure.

🏛 COSO ERM 2017 Mapping

This ERM framework aligns with the 5 COSO components:

1. Governance & Culture

Three Lines of Defense model.

Risk ownership assigned (Credit, Fraud, Tech, Compliance, Liquidity…).

Board Risk Committee oversight.

2. Strategy & Objective-Setting

ERM tied to strategic goals: loan growth, credit quality, operational stability.

Risk appetite defined for credit loss, fraud loss, liquidity ratio, uptime, compliance events.

3. Performance

Comprehensive risk scoring (L×I).

KRI dashboard with Green/Amber/Red thresholds.

Heatmap to visualize residual risk distribution.

Monitoring of default rate, Gini, uptime, fraud rate, LCR, PSI drift, etc.

4. Review & Revision

Monthly Risk Review: KRI evaluation, risk score updates.

Quarterly: stress testing, appetite review, Board reporting.

Incident-driven review (post-mortem within 5 days).

5. Information, Communication & Reporting

Structured monthly risk report format.

Escalation mechanisms.

Summary reporting to Senior Management & Board Risk Committee.

📊 Key Metrics (KRI)

Examples of KRIs used:

Risk Area	KRI	Thresholds
Credit Risk	Default Rate (%)	≤ 8% / 8–9% / > 9%
Fraud Risk	Fraud Loss (bps)	≤ 20 / 20–35 / > 35
Liquidity	LCR (%)	≥ 110 / 100–110 / < 100
Technology	System Uptime (%)	≥ 99.5 / 99–99.5 / < 99
Model Risk	PSI Drift	≤ 0.1 / 0.1–0.25 / > 0.25
🔥 Top Residual Risks (sample)

R001 – Default rate increase (Credit Risk) – High

R009 – Identity theft / Synthetic identity (Fraud Risk) – High

R004 – Liquidity stress scenario – Medium–High

R007 – Cloud / AWS outage – Medium–High

R013 – Model drift – Medium

(Details in the PPT & Excel.)

🛡 Risk Appetite Summary

Credit Loss: ≤ 8%

Fraud Loss: ≤ 2%

Liquidity LCR: ≥ 110%

Uptime: ≥ 99.5%

Compliance violations: 0 major findings

Data Privacy incidents: 0 severe PII leaks
